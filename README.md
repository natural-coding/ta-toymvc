A test assignment about the MVC pattern

Application requirements
-----------------------

You should create a textbook web application. Each problem contains the 
following fields: username, e-mail, problem text, status (solved or not)

An anonymous user should be able to do the following:
- Discover all the problems on a homepage
- Sort the problems by username, e-mail, status
- Add problems to the textbook

You have to use the pagination to display problems (3 items per page).
It should be possible to log on as an administrator (userame: admin, 
password: 123).

The administrator should able to do the following:
- Modify the problem text
- Change the problem status

If the problem was modified, you should mark it as "Modified by 
administrator".

Technology stack
----------------

- You should complete the task using  plain PHP, NO frameworks.
- You should use the MVC pattern along the way.
- You are free to use any components or libraries.
- There is no need to create a complex MVC framework for solving this test 
assignment. The golden rules are: keep it simple, make it work.
- You should use the Bootstrap framework for styling webpages.
- There is no any strict requirements for the web design.
- You should deploy your work somewhere and send us a URL.

Good luck.
